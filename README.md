# mmult-gui
A GUI version of my mmult project. This time done in Python/HTML/CSS and the p5.js library


Converted the needed matrix math functions from C to python for easier access from a web application.

Right now you can:
  - Select a matrix size using a pretty nice draggy-clicky thing!
  - Generate HTML input objects via javascript (non-functional, not pretty)
  - Watch me cry in shame because this project is still incomplete!
